Notes:
-> Code generation templates + functions that generate code from templates + variables (look into templating libraries for python)
-> Make dynamic predictor easier to read (document the various steps ) + hide away some less relevant logic stuff in methods
-> Add parallelization whever it can fit (important: encoder preping)
-> Look into Caffe syntax (and js conv net by karapthy)
